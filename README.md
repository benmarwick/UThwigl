# iDADwigl

The goal of iDADwigl is to compute open-system uranium-thorium ages of geological and archaeological samples. It is based on the diffusion-adsorption-decay (DAD) model of Sambridge et al. (2012), which allows for advective and diffusive transport of uranium and thorium isotopes, while including synchronous radioactive decay.

The main function, `iDADwigl()`, will take the (^230^Th/^238^U) and (^234^U/^238^U) activity ratios collected along a transect perpendicular to the surface of the tooth or bone and return an age in thousands of years ago.

## Installation
