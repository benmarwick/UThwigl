# iDADwigl

The goal of iDADwigl is to compute open-system uranium-thorium ages of
geological and archaeological samples. It is based on the
diffusion-adsorption-decay (DAD) model of Sambridge et al. (2012), which
allows for advective and diffusive transport of uranium and thorium
isotopes, while including synchronous radioactive decay.

The main function, `iDADwigl()`, will take the
(<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U) and (<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U)
activity ratios collected along a transect perpendicular to the surface
of the tooth or bone and return an age in thousands of years ago.

## Installation

You can install the development version of iDADwigl from GitHub with:

``` r
source("https://install-github.me/tonydoss/iDADwigl")
```

## Example

Please see the [vignette](articles/idadwigl.pdf) for an example of how
