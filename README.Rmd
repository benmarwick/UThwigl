# UThwigl

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benmarwick/UThwigl) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio)

The goal of UThwigl is to compute closed- and open-system uranium-thorium (U-Th) ages of
geological and archaeological samples. Closed-system U-Th dating follows the principles presented in 
Edwards et al. (2003), Richards and Dorale (2003) and Ludwig (2003). Open-system U-Th dating is based on the
diffusion-adsorption-decay (DAD) model of Sambridge et al. (2012), which
allows for advective and diffusive transport of uranium and thorium
isotopes, while including synchronous radioactive decay.

The function, `csTuh()`, calculates closed-system ages and uses
(<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U) and (<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U)
activity ratios on a single analysis to return an age in thousands of years ago. The (<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U)
activity ratio is also needed for detrital correction.

The function, `osTuh()`, calculates open-system ages and take the
(<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U) and (<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U)
activity ratios collected along a transect perpendicular to the surface
of the tooth or bone and return an age in thousands of years ago.

## Web application

The package includes a web application that runs `osTuh()` in your browser where you can upload your CSV file, set the model parameters, run the model, and view the results. Choose this option is you are not familiar with R. Here's a screenshot of the web app:

## Run code without downloading anything 

You can run the package functions in your browser by [starting a binder instance](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/UThwigl/master?urlpath=rstudio). This will open RStudio in your browser, together with the contents of this GitHub repository. 

## Installing the UThwigl package on your computer

To  install the development version of UThwigl from GitHub on your computer, run:

``` r
source("https://install-github.me/tonydoss/UThwigl")
```

Please see the [vignette](articles/uthwigl.pdf) for an example of how to use this package.
